Hello, 

Within this repository you'll find the first couple of pages that I have ever worked on using html. 

I've put them together by following the steps in the Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp. Taught by Jose Portilla Head of Data Science, Pierian Data Inc. On Udemy

I will be adding notes on each complete file below as I finish them.

If you have any-feed back / tips please do not hesitate to leave a comment. Thank You!
